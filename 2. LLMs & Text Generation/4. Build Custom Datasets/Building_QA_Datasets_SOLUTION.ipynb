    "# Building Question Answering Datasets\n",
    "In this exercise, we want to construct a dataset for training a question answering model. \n",
    "In general, this process is highly manual, requiring the collection of data and, as one might expect, manually constructing pairs of questions and answers that can be found in the text. \n",
    "In our exercise, we provide the data plus question and answer pairs, and work through how to construct the dataset from that starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQuAD\n",
    "One of the most well studied datasets in question answering is the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), introduced in a paper by [Rajpurkar et al.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/rajpurkar2016squad.pdf) and its follow-up, [SQuAD 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822).\n",
    "Formatting our dataset like SQuAD makes it much easier to use prebuild models and trainers like those from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to do our job, so it makes sense to first understand the structure of the dataset.\n",
    "What follows is a single example from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "{'id': '573387acd058e614000b5cb5',\n",

    " 'context': 'One of the main driving forces in the growth of the University was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins, 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\". Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne\\'s offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930 when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.',\n",
    " 'question': 'In what year did the team lead by Knute Rockne win the Rose Bowl?',\n",

    "  'answers': dict\n",
    " }\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we can simply ignore the 'title' entry if we wish -- it has no impact on our ability to use the dataset, but can be important for others, as it maps to the title of the article from which the context is drawn.\n",
    "The answers are themselves a dict with structure:\n",
    " \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "{'text': list(str),\n",
    " 'answer_start': list(int)\n",

Users are advised to install the applicable firmware updates for optimal protection. What is the vulnerability? A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP. What versions are vulnerable—and what should you do? After a thorough investigation, we’ve identified the vulnerable products and are releasing firmware patches to address the issue, as shown in the table below. For optimal protection, we urge users to install the applicable updates. For those not listed, they are not affected. Contact your local Zyxel support team if you require further assistance or visit our  forum  for more information. Got a question or a tipoff? Please contact your local service rep for further information or assistance. If you’ve found a vulnerability, we want to work with you to fix it—contact  security@zyxel.com.tw  and we’ll get right back to you. Acknowledgment Thanks to Niels Teusink at EYE for reporting the issue to us. Revision history 2020-12-23: Initial release 2020-12-24: Updated the acknowledgement section 2021-01-04: Updated the patch schedule for AP controllers 2021-01-08: Added the forum link', 'question': 'Who is the manufacturer of the product?', 'answers': {'answer_start': [30], 'text': ['Zyxel']}}\n"
